# **Build a square** 

Practice rspec with codewars kata. 

## **Instructions:**

I will give you an integer. Give me back a shape that is as long and wide as 
the integer. The integer will be a whole number between 0 and 50.

Example: Integer = 3; I expect a 3x3 square back just like below as a string.
